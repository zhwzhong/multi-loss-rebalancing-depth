Large files can be downloaded using the following link.

### 2.1. NYUv2 dataset
NYUv2 training and evaluation data are obtained by reprocessing what is provided on the [official site](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html). You can easily use the reprocessed data with the link below.

All depth maps are saved as 16bit png files.

Depths are mapped by the following formula: depth = double(value) / (2^16 - 1) * 10

- 654 RGBD pairs for evaluation: [test654.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1scqBb4kCB82ssDoO8UfvrWUubYH_hjXs/view?usp=sharing)

- 795 RGBD pairs for training: [train795.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VNRsXzc0MMjjXLdJpcwBTh1eosif7orU/view?usp=sharing)
